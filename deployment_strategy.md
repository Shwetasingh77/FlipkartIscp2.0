Deployment Approach

The proposed PII detection solution will be deployed as a containerized microservice running within the organization’s infrastructure. The service will expose a simple REST API to which applications or internal tools can send datasets (e.g., CSV, Excel) for PII detection and redaction.

Where It Lives

Application Layer (Internal Tool Integration):
The solution will run as a standalone Python microservice, deployed either on a virtual machine or in a container (Docker/Kubernetes).

Applications that handle user data (e.g., CRM, HR tools, analytics pipelines) can forward files to this service for scanning before storage or processing.

Alternative: API Gateway Plugin
For real-time protection, the same logic can be wrapped as a plugin in an API Gateway. Any incoming data payload would be inspected for PII before reaching downstream services.

Justification

Scalability:
Containerization ensures the service can be horizontally scaled (multiple replicas on Kubernetes or Docker Swarm) to handle high loads.

Latency:
Since the service only scans payloads on request, it introduces minimal latency (~milliseconds per payload).

Cost-effectiveness:
Deploying as a container avoids dedicated hardware costs. It reuses existing infrastructure and scales only when required.

Ease of Integration:
By exposing a REST API, the service can integrate easily with multiple systems—internal tools, web applications, or ETL pipelines—without requiring major code changes.

Security Considerations

Data Encryption: All payloads sent to the service will use HTTPS/TLS for secure transmission.

Access Control: Only authorized applications/users can call the PII detection service via API keys or IAM policies.

Logging & Monitoring: Logs will capture detection events for audit purposes, while avoiding storage of raw PII.

Example Deployment Scenarios

DaemonSet on Kubernetes: Ensures every node has the PII detection agent running locally.

Sidecar Container: Deployed alongside applications that handle sensitive data, scanning payloads before processing.

Centralized Microservice: A single scalable API service integrated with data ingestion pipelines.
